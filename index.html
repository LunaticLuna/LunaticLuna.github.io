                    <h1> About </h1>
                    <p>Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
                    She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
                    Exit Servant

                    Is this a dagger which I see before me,
                    The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
                    I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
                    Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
                    To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
                    A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
                    Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
                    I see thee yet, in form as palpable
                    As this which now I draw.
                    Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
                    And such an instrument I was to use.
                    Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
                    Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
                    And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
                    Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
                    It is the bloody business which informs
                    Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
                    Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
                    The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
                    Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,
                    Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
                    Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
                    With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
                    Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
                    Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
                    Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
                    And take the present horror from the time,
                    Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
                    Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
                    A bell rings

                    I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
                    Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
                    That summons thee to heaven or to hell.
